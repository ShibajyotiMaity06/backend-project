in mongoose while connecting if using createConnection ( new version) then we cant use async await because it dosent return a
promise 
const connectionInstance = await mongoose.createConnection(
      ${process.env.MONGODB_URL}/${DB_NAME}   wrong this is 

hence we use only mongoose.connect
and in createConnection there is no connection.host property

if you chanhe anything in .env then nodemodule cant do anything we have to manuaaly restarrt
